# Work-Scheduler

Challenge-5

***

The challenege for this week was to take some starter code and create a functional schedule for a normal 9 to 5 work day. The acceptance criteria goes as follows:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist

***

In the html file, I added time blocks until 5pm

In the js file, I added a function to display the current day and time above the schedule

I created a function to set the appropriate class (past, present, or future) for each time block

I added a click event to the save button that locally stores saved events

I created a start new day button that allows the user to clear all events and start a fresh new work-scheduler
